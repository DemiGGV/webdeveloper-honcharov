# Description.


Hi, I'm fullstack developer, Heorhii Honcharov, and this is my portfolio site. This site is written as a react application, built with Vite. On this site you can check out my other projects like simple HTML-CSS layout, vanilla Javascript and REACT applications, team projects, and backend projects.
This project is based on a simple free Figma design, redesigned by me: added modal project windows, added animations, added adaptability for different screen formats. The layout of the project is created according to the principle: mobile-first.
